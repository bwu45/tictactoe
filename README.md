# Tic tac toe
- Simple tic tac toe game playable from the console

# Learning Objectives
- The only purpose of this project was to build a very simple game from scratch WITHOUT guidance. Although I did look up a tutorial, I only used it as a starting point and only skimmed through the video when I got stuck. yippie!! 😁😁😁
- computer difficulty (still need)
- random starting player vs computer (still need)
- play again function (still need) 

# Instructions

- Game goes until either player or computer wins, or ties
